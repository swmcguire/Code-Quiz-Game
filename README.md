Coding Quiz Game 

To prepare myself for any future JavaScript Interviews I created a quiz game that will 1. Help me study for any potential questions as well as give me something to show a potential employer.  This will show any employers that I have the necessary skillset to hire me.

The breakdown of the project is as follows:

When I load the page, and click the 'Start' button, the timer begins.  It starts counting down and every question that I get correct adds :10 seconds.  Any question I get incorrect will remove :10 seconds.

At the end of the quiz, it will take my high score and save it to a High Score page.  If the timer 0s out before I can finish, it will say "Game Over!"

This was an incredibly stressful project but I learned a ton, there were a lot of "A-HA" moments which was a great feeling.


## Installation

No installation needed - when you load the page you can click the 'Start' button and it will begin the application.

## Usage

When I load the page, and click the 'Start' button, the timer begins.  It starts counting down and every question that I get correct adds :10 seconds.  Any question I get incorrect will remove :10 seconds.

At the end of the quiz, it will take my high score and save it to a High Score page.  If the timer 0s out before I can finish, it will say "Game Over!"
